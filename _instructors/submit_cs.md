submit.cs, online at <https://submit.cs.ucsb.edu> is a home-grown autograder system, developed by Bryce Boe as
part of his Ph.D. dissertation while he was a student at UCSB.

Reusing programming assignments that are already set up in submit.cs is relatively straightforward.

Constructing new programming assignments can be somewhat tedious, but is possible.

If you are using submit.cs, be advised that the system is currently somewhat on "life-support".     It works well, when it works---but
when it breaks, there is not a particularly good support infrastructure in place to take care of problems that arise.   Another way to say it is: 
it is supported by faculty members, and volunteers, not by dedicated support professionals.

There is a long-term plan to migrate to an autograder solution with a better support infrastructure and support team.   For the time being,
submit.cs support isn't great, but it may be the best we can do.
