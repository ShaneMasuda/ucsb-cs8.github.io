C++ was introduced by Bjarne Straustroup, an employee of Bell Labs, in 1979, first under the name "C with classes".    It was later renamed
C++.    The first edition of the first book about C++, 
[The C++ Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C%2B%2B_Programming_Language) was published in 1985, which is also
also the year that the first commerical implementation was made available.

Even though C++ is over 30 years old, it is still widely used, especially in systems that need raw compute speed.
