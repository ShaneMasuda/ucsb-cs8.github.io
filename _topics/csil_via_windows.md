Two options:

(1) Use MobaXTerm.

<https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/>

Upper left is a button "Open session" then upper left is a button like "open ssh".  Or something like that.

For "host" enter `csil-04.cs.ucsb.edu` where `04` is replaced by any number between 01 and 48

username is your CSIL username.

Good luck.
